## Hi there 👋

I'm **Hrithik Turaka**, a freshman at the University of Colorado Denver majoring in **Electrical Engineering** with a strong interest in **semiconductors**—especially **ASICs,** **digital logic, circuits, and computer engineering** 🎓.

I’m early in my journey and still building experience, but I’m actively working to grow my skills through coursework, labs, and personal projects. I care a lot about learning the fundamentals and applying them to real-world problems.

### Relevant Coursework 📚

**Fall 2025** 

- **ELEC 1510: Digital Logic**
- Designed combinational and sequential switching circuits  
- Used Boolean algebra, K-maps, and algorithmic state machines  
- Simulated designs in Verilog/SystemVerilog using Intel Quartus Prime

**Spring 2026**  
**ELEC 1520: Programming for Electrical Engineers**  
- Learning C/C++ and Python for engineering problem-solving  
- Focusing on data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design  
- Building skills in testing, debugging, and computer system fundamentals  


### What I'm Learning 📖

- **ELEC 1520: Programming for Electrical Engineers** – Circuit design, K-maps, state machines, Verilog simulation  
- Fundamentals of semiconductor devices and their applications  
- CPU/GPU/FPGA architecture basics

### Tools & Technologies 🧰

- Intel Quartus Prime (FPGA development)  
- Verilog  
- C/C++ and Python (in progress)  
- Git & GitHub  

### Goals

- Build digital logic and FPGA projects to share here  
- Deepen my understanding of CPU/GPU and ASIC design  
- Land an internship in semiconductors or hardware engineering
