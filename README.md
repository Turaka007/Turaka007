## Hi there 👋

I'm **Hrithik Turaka**, a freshman at the University of Colorado Denver majoring in **Electrical Engineering** with a minor in **Computer Engineering**, and a focused passion for **semiconductors**—specifically **ASIC design, GPU architecture, and digital logic systems** 🎓.

I'm building a strong foundation in RTL design, digital systems, and hardware verification while actively working to understand the full semiconductor design flow. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge chip design anywhere I can.

### Current Focus 🎯

- **RTL Design & Digital Logic**: Mastering synchronous design, state machines, combinational/sequential circuits, and hardware description languages
- **ASIC + GPU Specialization**: Understanding how GPU cores are specialized ASICs and positioning myself for GPU ASIC design roles
- **Building a Portfolio**: Creating hands-on projects that demonstrate RTL fundamentals and design thinking

### Relevant Coursework 📚

**Fall 2025**  
**ELEC 1510: Digital Logic Design**
- Designed combinational and sequential switching circuits
- Applied Boolean algebra, Karnaugh maps (K-maps), and algorithmic state machines (ASMs)
- Simulated circuits in Verilog/Behavioral Verilog using Intel Quartus Prime 18.1
- Foundation: Synchronous logic, timing, and basic RTL thinking

**Spring 2026**  
**ELEC 1520: Programming for Electrical Engineers (C/C++)**
- Learning C/C++ and embedded systems fundamentals
- Building understanding of how high-level code maps to hardware
- Focus: Thinking in parallelism and hardware constraints, not algorithmic optimization
- Ongoing: Supplementing with independent Verilog/SystemVerilog study

### Skills & Tools 🧰

**Hardware Description Languages**
- Verilog (primary focus for RTL design)
- Intel Quartus Prime 18.1 (FPGA synthesis and simulation)

**Programming**
- C/C++ (in progress via coursework)
- Python (for scripting and data analysis)
- Git & GitHub (version control and portfolio management)

**Foundational Knowledge**
- Digital logic, Boolean algebra, K-maps, state machines
- Synchronous circuit design and basic timing analysis
- FPGA simulation and synthesis workflows
